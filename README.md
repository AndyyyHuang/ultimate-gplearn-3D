## A Enhanced Version of GPlearn for 3-Dimensional Factor Evolution <!-- omit in toc -->

</div>

### Customized Fitness Evaluator
I implement several new fitness functions tailored for the 3-dimensional factor evolution with built-in backtesting framework, allowing you to guide the evolution process directly with your strategy's performance which based on the factor.

### Tailored Genetic Operators
This updated package now includes an expanded set of base operators, covering both time-series and cross-sectional operations. Additionally, I incorporate ta-lib's technical indicators and refined these indicators to better suit the 3-dimensional factor evolution.
